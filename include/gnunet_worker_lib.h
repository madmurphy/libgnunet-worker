                `GNUNET_WORKER_ERR_THREAD_CREATE`

    Any non-zero value indicates that the worker has not been created and the
    call was no-op.

    If you want to exploit the facilities offered by `GNUNET_PROGRAM_run()`
    together with the facilities offered by this framework, you can launch
    `GNUNET_PROGRAM_run2()` -- called with `GNUNET_YES` as last argument so
    that another GNUnet scheduler is not run -- and then invoke
    `GNUNET_WORKER_create()` inside the `GNUNET_PROGRAM_Main` function of your
    application. See the comments in `examples/gtk4-example/foobar-main.c` for
    a possible example.

    The @p on_worker_end routine is not like any routine, but represents a
    point of no return after which it becomes illegal to attempt to destroy a
    worker (and, if you are lucky, attempting to do so will result in an error
    message and a `GNUNET_WORKER_ERR_DOUBLE_FREE` error code). On the other
    hand, attempting to destroy a worker before @p on_worker_end has returned
    is always safe. Thus, if a program allows different threads to destroy a
    worker and these do not behave deterministically (e.g., user interaction),
    you must use the @p on_worker_end routine to set a global variable to some
    value that prevents other threads to use the worker's address ever again.

    If @p save_handle is not `NULL`, it will be used to store a handle for the
    new worker before exiting. If the function returns a non-zero value the
    original address of @p save_handle will be left untouched.

    If @p save_handle is `NULL`, the calling thread will have no way to access
    the worker created, unless the latter stores the return value of
    `GNUNET_WORKER_get_current_handle()` into a global/shared variable.

                `GNUNET_WORKER_ERR_THREAD_CREATE`

    Any non-zero value indicates that the worker has not been created and the
    call was no-op.

    If you want to exploit the facilities offered by `GNUNET_PROGRAM_run()`
    together with the facilities offered by this framework, you can launch

    `GNUNET_WORKER_create()` inside the `GNUNET_PROGRAM_Main` function of your
    application. See `examples/gtk4-example/foobar-main.c` for a possible
    example.

    This function will not return until the scheduler returns. The @p master
    thread, or equivalently any other thread, must eventually take care of
    destroying the worker after using it, or the caller thread will continue
    hanging indefinitely with the scheduler running.

    The caller thread, which has now become a worker thread, can also shut down
    the scheduler and free the memory allocated for the worker by invoking
    `GNUNET_SCHEDULER_shutdown()`.

    If @p master_routine is non-`Ç¸ULL`, it will be launched in a new detached
    (non-joinable) thread. If @p master_routine is `NULL` there will be
    apparently little difference between invoking directly
    `GNUNET_SCHEDULER_run()` and invoking this function. However, there will be
    an important difference when new threads will be manually launched later:
    `GNUNET_WORKER_push_load()` will now be at other threads' disposal.

    If @p save_handle is not `NULL`, it will be used to store a handle for the
    new worker, right after @p master_routine has been launched in a new thread
    (if it applies), but before the scheduler has been started. If this
    function returns a non-zero value the original address of @p save_handle
    will be left untouched.

    The @p on_worker_end routine is not like any routine, but represents a
    point of no return after which it becomes illegal to attempt to destroy a
    worker (and, if you are lucky, attempting to do so will result in an error
    message and a `GNUNET_WORKER_ERR_DOUBLE_FREE` error code). On the other
    hand, attempting to destroy a worker before @p on_worker_end has returned
    is always safe. Thus, if a program allows different threads to destroy a
    worker and these do not behave deterministically (e.g., user interaction),
    you must use the @p on_worker_end routine to set a global variable to some
    value that prevents other threads to use the worker's address ever again.

                `GNUNET_WORKER_ERR_THREAD_CREATE`

    Any non-zero value indicates that the worker has not been created and the
    call was no-op.

    This is the only function that requires that the user has already started
    the GNUnet scheduler manually (either via `GNUNET_SCHEDULER_run()` or
    `GNUNET_PROGRAM_run()`). Calling this function without the scheduler
    running will result in undefined behavior.

    The `on_worker_start` argument is missing by design, as differently than
    `GNUNET_WORKER_start_serving()` this function returns immediately (in what
    has now become a worker thread).

    If @p master_routine is non-`Ç¸ULL`, it will be launched in a new detached
    (non-joinable) thread.

    If later the user wants to go back to using the scheduler without
    interferences from other threads the `GNUNET_WORKER_dismiss()` function is
    available.

    If @p save_handle is not `NULL`, it will be used to store a handle for the
    new worker, right after @p master_routine has been launched in a new thread
    (if it applies). If this function returns a non-zero value the original
    address of @p save_handle will be left untouched.

    The @p on_worker_end routine is not like any routine, but represents a

                `GNUNET_WORKER_ERR_INVALID_HANDLE`

    This function is identical to `GNUNET_WORKER_push_load()`, but allows to
    specify the priority whereby a job will be scheduled.

    The `GNUNET_SCHEDULER_Priority` enumeration type is defined in
    `/usr/include/gnunet/gnunet_common.h`. Possible priorities, from the lowest
    to the highest, are:

    - `GNUNET_SCHEDULER_PRIORITY_IDLE`
    - `GNUNET_SCHEDULER_PRIORITY_BACKGROUND`
    - `GNUNET_SCHEDULER_PRIORITY_DEFAULT`
    - `GNUNET_SCHEDULER_PRIORITY_HIGH`
    - `GNUNET_SCHEDULER_PRIORITY_UI`
    - `GNUNET_SCHEDULER_PRIORITY_URGENT`
    - `GNUNET_SCHEDULER_PRIORITY_SHUTDOWN`

    The additional `GNUNET_SCHEDULER_PRIORITY_KEEP` cannot be used in this
    context.

    The functions pushed into the worker thread are free to use all the
    scheduler's utilities (such as `GNUNET_SCHEDULER_add_with_priority()`,
    `GNUNET_SCHEDULER_add_delayed_with_priority()`, and so on). Invoking
    `GNUNET_SCHEDULER_shutdown()` from the scheduler's thread will be
    equivalent to invoking `GNUNET_WORKER_*_destroy()` from any other thread
    (i.e., the memory previously allocated for the worker will be destroyed).

    A non-zero return value indicates that @p job_routine was not scheduled
    (the call was no-op and the user may attempt again).

    Use this routine every time you want to run a function in a worker thread.
    For specifying a priority, the `GNUNET_WORKER_push_load_with_priority()`
    function is available.

    The functions pushed into the worker thread are free to use all the
    scheduler's utilities (such as `GNUNET_SCHEDULER_add_with_priority()`,
    `GNUNET_SCHEDULER_add_delayed_with_priority()`, etc.). Invoking
    `GNUNET_SCHEDULER_shutdown()` from the scheduler's thread will be
    equivalent to invoking `GNUNET_WORKER_*_destroy()` from any other thread
    (i.e., the memory previously allocated for the worker will be destroyed).

    A non-zero return value indicates that @p job_routine was not scheduled
    (the call was no-op and the user may attempt again).

    A return value of `GNUNET_WORKER_ERR_INVALID_HANDLE` indicates that the
    worker is beeing destroyed by this or another thread. If this happens, the
    caller's code is in a dangerous position: the next time, instead of a
    handle in the process of being destroyed, an already destroyed handle might
    be passed to this function, and that will cause undefined behavior
    (probably a crash). This error must be handled exactly like a double free
    or corruption error, and you should always pay attention that a worker's
    address is never used again after a worker has been destroyed. You must not
    handle `GNUNET_WORKER_ERR_INVALID_HANDLE` using runtime checks unless you
    are debugging your program; the way to handle this error is by writing code
    that does not use a worker's address after this has been destroyed. Please
    have a look at the documentation of either `GNUNET_WORKER_start_serving()`,
    `GNUNET_WORKER_create()` or `GNUNET_WORKER_adopt_running_scheduler()` for
    more information on how to avoid that his happens.

    @brief      Terminate a worker and free its memory, without waiting for the
                scheduler to return -- this will be completed in parallel
                (asynchronous)
    @param      worker          The worker to destroy            [NON-NULLABLE]
    @return     Possible return values are `GNUNET_WORKER_SUCCESS` (`0`),
                `GNUNET_WORKER_ERR_DOUBLE_FREE` and `GNUNET_WORKER_ERR_SIGNAL`

    This function is used to launch `GNUNET_SCHEDULER_shutdown()` in the worker
    thread, without waiting for the scheduler to return.

    Functions already scheduled via `GNUNET_WORKER_push_load()` that had no
    time to be invoked will be immediately cancelled. If the user had passed an
    `on_worker_end` routine during the creation of the worker, this will be
    launched now.

    This function can be invoked by any thread (including the worker thread as
    well). Directly launching `GNUNET_SCHEDULER_shutdown()` from the worker
    thread will have identical effects to launching this function from any
    other thread (i.e., the memory previously allocated for the worker will be
    destroyed).

    A return value of `GNUNET_WORKER_ERR_DOUBLE_FREE` indicates that another
    thread has already triggered the worker's destruction (this includes having
    invoked `GNUNET_SCHEDULER_shutdown()` from the scheduler itself). If this
    happens, the caller's code is in a dangerous position: the next time,
    instead of a handle in the process of being destroyed, an already destroyed
    handle might be passed to this function, and that will cause undefined
    behavior (probably a crash). This error must be handled exactly like a
    double free or corruption error, and you should always pay attention that
    no more than one thread can destroy the worker. You must not handle
    `GNUNET_WORKER_ERR_DOUBLE_FREE` using runtime checks unless you are
    debugging your program; the way to handle this error is by writing code
    that does not destroy a worker twice. Please have a look at the
    documentation of either `GNUNET_WORKER_adopt_running_scheduler()`,
    `GNUNET_WORKER_start_serving()` or `GNUNET_WORKER_create()` for more
    information on how to avoid that his happens. It is very likely that this
    error code will be removed in the future and a call to `exit()` will appear
    in its place.

    A value of `GNUNET_WORKER_ERR_SIGNAL` indicates that it was not possible to
    notify the worker about the shutdown (this error can be thrown only if this
    function was not invoked from the worker thread). In this case there is not
    much to do. The return value was caused by an error during `write()` into
    the worker's pipe. The only way to know whether the worker has received the
    message or not is by passing an `on_worker_end` routine during the creation
    of the worker and let it signal about the shutdown happening. If no signal
    arrives it is possible to try and wake up the worker for the shutdown by
    using `GNUNET_WORKER_ping()` or by invoking this function again. A pipe
    breaking is a very unlikely event to occur, and it might make sense to
    ignore completely the possible `GNUNET_WORKER_ERR_SIGNAL` return value,
    assume that the worker has been destroyed, and tolerate the rare events of
    workers turned into zombies; or alternatively, it might be a good idea to
    launch `exit()`, if a worker turns into a zombie.

    Once invoked, this function uninstalls the load listener from the scheduler
    and frees the memory allocated with the worker, but lets the scheduler
    live. In short: it turns a worker thread back into a classic GNUnet
    scheduler, without any multithreading facility and without a load listener.

    Although it can be invoked on any worker, independently from how this was
    created, `GNUNET_WORKER_dismiss()` is often paired with
    `GNUNET_WORKER_adopt_running_scheduler()`, for making a scheduler serve as
    a worker only temporarily, before continuing its work without interferences
    from other threads.

    Functions already scheduled via `GNUNET_WORKER_push_load()` that had no
    time to be invoked will be immediately cancelled. If the user had passed an
