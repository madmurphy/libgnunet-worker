/**

    @brief      The priority whereby the listener will wake up after a beep

    What priority should we assign to this? The listener itself can schedule
    jobs with different priorities, including potentially high priority ones,
    and after detecting a shutdown it will invoke `GNUNET_SCHEDULER_shutdown()`
    directly, without scheduling it.

    Would it make sense to give low priority to it, instead of high priority?

    In favor of low priority: if threads push multiple jobs at once the
    listener will likely wake up less often and will schedule more tasks in a
    single run.

    Against low priority: if the user pushes a job with
    `GNUNET_SCHEDULER_PRIORITY_HIGH`, this would anyway have to face the
    listener's low priority bottleneck.
