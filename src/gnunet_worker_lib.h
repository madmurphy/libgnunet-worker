    This function will not return until the scheduler returns. The @p master
    thread, or equivalently any other thread, must eventually take care of
    destroying the worker after using it, or otherwise the caller thread will
    continue hanging indefinitely with the scheduler running.

    The caller thread, which has now become a worker thread, can also destroy
    shut down the scheduler and free the memory allocated for the worker by
    invoking `GNUNET_SCHEDULER_shutdown()`.

    If @p master_routine is non-`Ç¸ULL`, the function passed will be launched in
    a new detached (non-joinable) thread. If @p master_routine is `NULL` there
    will be apparently little difference between invoking directly
    `GNUNET_SCHEDULER_run()` and invoking this function. However when later new
    threads will be manually launched there will be an important difference:
    `GNUNET_WORKER_push_load()` will now be at other threads' disposal.

    If @p save_handle is not `NULL`, it will be used to store a handle for the
    current session. The variable is set very early, before launching the
    @p master thread and before starting the scheduler.

    The `GNUNET_SCHEDULER_Priority` enumeration type is defined in

    to the highest, are:

    scheduler's utilities (such as `GNUNET_SCHEDULER_add_with_priority()`,
    `GNUNET_SCHEDULER_add_delayed_with_priority()`, etc.). Invoking
    `GNUNET_SCHEDULER_shutdown()` from the scheduler's thread will be
    equivalent to invoking `GNUNET_WORKER_*_destroy()` from another thread
    (i.e., the memory previously allocated for the worker will be destroyed).

    This function is used to launch `GNUNET_SCHEDULER_shutdown()` from another
    thread, without waiting for the scheduler to return.

    Functions already scheduled via `GNUNET_WORKER_push_load()` that had no
    time to be invoked will be immediately cancelled. However, if the user had
    passed an `on_worker_end` routine during the creation of the worker, this
    will be launched now.

    This function can be invoked by any thread (including the worker thread).
    Directly launching `GNUNET_SCHEDULER_shutdown()` from a worker thread
    will have identical effects to launching this function from another thread
    (i.e., the memory previously allocated for the worker will be destroyed).

    A return value of `GNUNET_WORKER_ERR_DOUBLE_FREE` indicates that another
    thread has already triggered the scheduler's shutdown (this includes having
    invoked `GNUNET_SCHEDULER_shutdown()` from the scheduler itself). If this
    happens the caller's code is in a dangerous position: the next time,
    instead of a handle in the process of being destroyed, an already destroyed
    handle might be passed to this function, and that will cause undefined
    behavior (probably a crash). This error must be handled exactly like a
    double free or corruption error.

    Zero or `GNUNET_WORKER_ERR_DOUBLE_FREE` indicate that the scheduler will
    eventually shut down; `GNUNET_WORKER_ERR_NOTIFICATION` instead indicates
    that it was not possible to notify the scheduler about the shutdown (this
    error can be thrown only if this function was not invoked from a worker
    thread). In this case there is not much to do. The return value is caused
    by an error during `write()` into the worker's pipe. The only way to know
    whether the worker has received the message or not is by passing an
    `on_worker_end` routine during the creation of the worker and let it signal
    about the shutdown happening. If no signal arrives it is possible to try to
    wake up the worker for the shutdown by using `GNUNET_WORKER_ping()`. A pipe
    breaking is a very unlikely event to occur, and it might make sense to
    ignore the possible `GNUNET_WORKER_ERR_NOTIFICATION` return value, assume
    that the worker has been destroyed, and tolerate the rare events of workers
    turned into zombies.

    A return value of `GNUNET_WORKER_ERR_UNKNOWN` can only be due to a

    in use.

    A value of `GNUNET_WORKER_ERR_NOTIFICATION` indicates that it was not
    possible to notify the scheduler about the shutdown (this error can be

    thread has already triggered the scheduler's shutdown (this includes having
    invoked `GNUNET_SCHEDULER_shutdown()` from the scheduler itself). If this
    happens the caller's code is in a dangerous position: the next time,
    instead of a handle in the process of being destroyed, an already destroyed
    handle might be passed to this function, and that will cause undefined
    behavior (probably a crash). This error must be handled exactly like a
    double free or corruption error.

    A return value of `GNUNET_WORKER_ERR_UNKNOWN` can only be due to a
    non-standard implementation of the `pthread_cond_wait()` function currently
    in use.

    A value of `GNUNET_WORKER_ERR_NOTIFICATION` indicates that it was not
    possible to notify the scheduler about the shutdown (this error can be
    thrown only if this function was not invoked from a worker thread). In this
    case there is not much to do. The return value is caused by an error during
    `write()` into the worker's pipe. The only way to know whether the worker
    has received the message or not is by passing an `on_worker_end` routine
    during the creation of the worker and let it signal about the shutdown
    happening. If no signal arrives it is possible to try to wake up the worker
    for the shutdown by using `GNUNET_WORKER_ping()`. A pipe breaking is a very
    unlikely event to occur, and it might make sense to ignore the possible
    `GNUNET_WORKER_ERR_NOTIFICATION` return value, assume that the worker has
    been destroyed, and tolerate the rare events of workers turned into
    zombies.

    A value of `GNUNET_WORKER_ERR_INTERNAL_BUG` should never be returned;
    please check the log and fill a bug report if it happens.

    @brief      Uninstall and destroy a worker without shutting down its
                scheduler
    @param      worker_handle   A pointer to the worker to dismiss
    @return     Possible return values are `GNUNET_WORKER_ERR_OK` (`0`),

                `GNUNET_WORKER_ERR_NOTIFICATION`

    Once invoked, this function uninstalls the load listener from the scheduler
    and frees the memory allocated for the worker, but lets the scheduler live.

    Although it can be invoked on any worker, this function is often paired
    with `GNUNET_WORKER_adopt_running_scheduler()`, for making a scheduler
    serve as a worker only temporarily, before continuing its work without
    interferences from other threads.

    Functions already scheduled via `GNUNET_WORKER_push_load()` that had no
    time to be invoked will be immediately cancelled. However, if the user had
    passed an `on_worker_end` routine during the creation of the worker, this
    will be launched now.
